Quantity | ~ 4 large buiscuits
Time to make | 40 minutes

> Preheat the oven to 180*C

## Base
- Coconut oil | 3 Tbsp |
- Brown Sugar | 1/4 cup | Ground

Cream oil & sugar together until light and fluffy. I usually do this by hand with a whisk.

> I grind the brown sugar beacuse the larger granules of brown sugar don't dissolve so well. \
> It's fine to not grind the sugar, you just get some sugar crystals in the final result.  \
> It's also fine to sub in a different sugar (where I usually just use the same quantity), and if it doesn't have large crystals then I don't gind it.

## Dry Mixture
- Buckwheat Flour | 2/4 cup | 
- Cornflour | 1/4 cup |
- Guar gum | 1/4 tsp |
- Dutch Cocoa | 3 Tbsp |

Sift the dry ingredients & mix them togehter

## Batter
- Soy milk |3/4 cup | Cold
- Cornflakes | 1 cup | lightly crushed

Mix the dry ingredients into the creamed oil & sugar to form a stiff batter \
Stir in the cornfalkes

## Baking

Line baking tray with baking paper \
Form the batter into balls & press out onto the baking tray \
Bake for 20 - 25 minutes at 180*C

> I've found these don't spread \
> As they tend to stay as they are left they can stand to be pressed a bit flatter

After baking, leave the biscuits on a wire rack to cool

## Topping
- Avacado | 1 avacado |
- Dutch cocoa | 3 Tbsp |
- Walnuts | 4 - 6 halves |

Blend the avacado and dutch cocoa together into a smooth ganache
Spread the ganache over the top of each biscuit and finish each with one walnt half
