Quantity | Fills the bottom of a loaf tin & makes 4 good brownies 
Time | 1 hour (no faffing)

> Remember to grease the loaf tin! you'll thank yourself later \
> Preheat the oven to 180*C

## Peanut Butter 
- Peanuts | 1/4 cup | Roasted
- Sunflower Seeds | 1/4 cup | Roasted
- Salt | to taste |
- Cayenne pepper | 1/8 tsp |

> Roast the peanuts and/or sunflower seeds up in the oven if not already roasted \
>  then leave the oven on at 180*C

Blend the peanuts, sunflower seeds, salt & Cayenne pepper together in the food processor untill you get a nice smooth nut butter

> use the food processor's small container - the aim is to make ~ 1/4 cup of nut butter (a couple table spoons over is fine) \
> water can also be added to the nut butter which gives a fluffier consistency to the nut butter

## Kūmara Mash

- Kūmara | 1 middling sized Kūmara | bake for 10 mins in the microwave
- Soy milk | 1/4 cup |

Mash the cooked Kūmara into a smooth paste with the soy milk. Aiming for ~ 1 cup of Kūmara mash

> I prefer purple Kūmara if I can get it, but orange will also do nicely \
> (If you're not from NZ and wondering WTF is Kūmara: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato#New_Zealand)

## Wet ingredients

- Flax fegg | 1 fegg | 1 Tbsp ground flax seed in 3 Tbsp hot water
- Vanilla essence | 1 tsp |
- Instant coffee | 1 Tbsp | mixed with a little water

> I'm using guar gum as the binder for the recipe, not the flax egg (fegg), so it's not really necessary but I sill like the texture it adds

Mix the fegg, vanilla & coffee together \
Then mix the sweet potato, nut butter & fegg mixture together into a smooth paste

> can be done in the food processor or with a spoon -- dish washer's choice

## Dry ingredients

- Buckwheat flour | 2/4 cup |
- Corn flour | 1/4 cup |
- Dutch cocoa powder | 1/4 cup |
- Guar gum | 1/4 tsp|
- Salt | 1/8 tsp |
- Baking powder | 1 tsp |
- Brown Sugar | 3 Tbsp | Ground (larger granuals won't disssolve)

Sift the dry ingredients to remove any lumps & then mix them all together into an even blend

## Mix it all up with the chocolate chips

- 100% chocolate slab | 1/2 bar | chopped up into chips
- 80% chocolate slab | a little less than 1/2 bar | chopped up into chips

> I'm using relativly small chocolate slab bars from craft chocolateers like [Ocho](https://ocho.co.nz/)\
> The aim is to have ~ 1/2 cup chocolate chips (though a little over is fine)

- Soy Milk | 1/2 cup |

Scoop the sweet potato mixture into the dry ingredients and mix togerther adding the soy milk a little at a time until the ingredients come together in a sticky paste

> The ammount of liqid you'll have as you mix the potato mixture into the dry ingredients won't be exactly the same each time this is made, so we go easy with the ammount of soy milk that is added at this step sort of eyeballing how much fluid is needed (or not) to compensate for how much fuid we have from the sweet potato and the nut butter

Throw the chocolate chips on to the sticky paste and mix them in

## Baking

Mixture fills the bottom of a loaf tin nicely \
You'll really want to grease the loaf tin or put in some brown paper or something beacuse the mixture is will stick like f**k to the tin

Bake at 180*C for 30 or 35 mins
