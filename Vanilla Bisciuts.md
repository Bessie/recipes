Quantity | 6 little bisciuts
Time to make | 45 mins

> Preheat the oven to 180*C

## Base
- Coconut oil | 3 Tbsp |
- Brown Sugar | 1/4 cup | Ground
- Vanilla | 1 tsp |

Cream oil & sugar together until light and fluffy. I usually do this by hand with a whisk. \
stir in the vanilla

> I grind the brown sugar beacuse the larger granules of brown sugar don't dissolve so well. \
> It's fine to not grind the sugar, you just get some sugar crystals in the final result.  \
> It's also fine to sub in a different sugar (where I usually just use the same quantity), and if it doesn't have large crystals then I don't gind it.

## Dry Mixture
- Buckwheat Flour | 2/4 cup | 
- Cornflour | 1/4 cup |
- Guar gum | 1/4 tsp |

Sift the dry ingredients & mix them togehter

## Dough
- Mixed fruit/ raisins & peanuts | 3-6 Tbsp (to taste) |
- ice water

Stir the butter sugar mix into the dry ingredients to make a texture like wet sand \
Add the ice water to the mixture slowly -- 1 Tbsp at a time -- just until the mixture comes together in a ball \
Stir the mixed fruit or raisins & peanuts into the batter

## Baking

Line a baking tray with baking paper \
With wet hands, take a small amount of dough & roll it into a ball \
Press flat onto the baking tray 

> they don't spread, so they can stand to be pressed quite flat

Bake for ~25 minutes at 180*C
