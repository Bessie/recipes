Source | From [Alison Marras' recipe](https://foodbymars.com/the-best-gluten-free-buckwheat-flour-bread-egg-free/)
Quantity | 1 loaf
Time to make | 2.5 hours

> warm the oven to ~50*C (beacuse we're in New Zealand and it's seldom warm enough to just leave the loaf to rise at ambient temperature)

## Activate yeast
- yeast | 3 tsp |
- water | 400 ml | lukewarm (about body temperature)
- sugar | 3 tsp |

Add the sugar & yeast to the water. Mix well & leave aside until it's got a nice frothy top (~ 10 mins)

## Dry ingredients
- Buckwheat flour | 3 cups |
- Guar gum | 3 tsp |
- Salt | 1/2 tsp |
- Flax seed | 3 Tbsp | whole/ coursly ground/ bit of both

Mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl

> The flax isn't there as binder, it's there for texture -- so just add to taste

## Batter
- apple cidar vinegar | 1 tsp |
- hemp seed oil | 3 Tbsp |

> really any vegetable oil will do, though you'll want something with either a pleasant or a bland flavour

Add the vinegar & oil to the yeasty water \ 
make a well in the dry ingredients & pour in the water mixture \
Stip it together until you have a thick smooth batter

## Baking
- coconut oil | as needed |

Grease the loaf tin with coconut oil \
Pour/ spoon the batter into the loaf tin

Turn the oven off & put the loaf in the oven to rise for about an hour and a half. 

> if it's left to rise too much it will colapse during baking \
> Does an overnight rise just fine if not left in a warm oven, will then tase more like yeast -- like a sourdough

Bake at 180*C for 25-30 mins
