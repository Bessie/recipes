# Recipes

This is a collection of vegan and gluten free baking recipes. They're all things I bake at home for myself and my parner. It follows in the tradition of hand written home baking recipes, of the kind that get passed down, passed around, and turned into community recipe books for fundraisers. 

## Recipie descriptions and language

The recipes are in markdown and follow a format adapted from the format described by Conrad Stoll and John Rodgers in [this gihhub repo](https://github.com/cnstoll/Grocery-Recipe-Format) 

### Metadata
Each Recipe opens with a metadata table like so: 

Metadata| -
---|---
Source | [URL]()
Quantity | 6 small buicusts
Time to make | 1 & 1/2 hours


### Characters
The following Markdown characters are used for the content of a recipe:

```
# Title
## Header
- Ingredient
Step
> Note
```

### Writing a recipe

Recipes are a combination of ingredients and the method for combining those ingredients. The typical recepie book style usually separtates those into two sections. 
The approach Conrad Stoll and John Rodgers take deviates from this style. Instead, ingredients are listed just above the steps they're used in, with groups of steps and ingrdients divided into sections. In this way, ingredients and method are combined in the way that you would think about and prepare a recipe rather than split into ingerdients and method. 

Notes then augment the recepie just like handwritten notes in the margins of a cookbook. They are notes to self that help you remember little things that make your life easier when baking like:

> grease the pan (yes, even if it's non-stick!)

**OR**

> Turn the oven on to pre-heat (180*C)

### Ingredients

Lines that include ingredients are denoted with the - character. Ingredients are followed by two | characters. The text after the first is the item note that describes how much of an item or what type. The text after the second is the prep note that describes anything you need to do to prepare the item.

```
- Flax fegg | 1 fegg | 1 Tbsp flax seeds ground & mixed with 3 Tbsp hot water 
```

**OR**

```
- Cinnamon | 1 stick | ground
```

If there is no prep note the second | is still included. As in:
```
- Salt | 1/2 tsp | 
```

### Photos

Any pictures of the finished product go at the bottom of the recepie (tempting as it may be at the time to put the recipe at the top, future me will not want the trouble of scrolling past the pictures to get to the recipe).
