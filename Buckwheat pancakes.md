Quantity | 6 - 7 pancakes
Time to make | 1 hour

## Flax emulsion 
- Flax fegg | 1 fegg | 1 Tbsp flax seed ground & soaked in 3 Tbsp hot water

prep the flax emulsion & leave to rest

## Dry ingredients
- Buckwheat flour | 1 1/4 cup |
- Brown sugar | 4 tsp | ground
- Baking powder | 1 Tbsp |
- Salt | 1/4 tsp |

Sift the dry ingredients to remove any lumps & mix them together

> Yes, that really is a tablespoon of baking powder -- it makes the pancakes nice and fluffy

## Batter
- Soy milk | 1 1/4 cup |
- Hemp seed oil | 2 Tbsp |
- Water | 1/2 cup |
- Vanilla essence | 1 tsp |

Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the flax emulsion, soy milk, oil, and vanilla (hold off on the water for now). \
Mix them all up into a thick batter adding as you go, or after using your judgement on how much of it to use. 

> Opinion is divided on how much to mix pancake batter. Some people say beat out all the lumps, some say lumps don't matter. Some say you shouldn't over-mix pancake batter. I usually mix the batter until there are no lumps, but I find any lumps that form in the early stages go away quite quickly, and beacuse I've sifted it, there are no hazardous clumps of baking powder... (biting into a clump of baking powder in your pancake is a v. bad experience). Also, I'm working with buckwheat flour which will not behave the same wrt over-mixing.

> Any oil will do here, or no oil at all. I think including oil in the recipe helps stop the pancakes from sticking, but honestly you're going to be putting them in the pan with oil anyway -- it really doesn't matter.

> What does matter is the amount of fluid in the recipe. It needs to be pourable, but not runny. You really have to make the recipe a couple of times and get how much water/soy milk to use to produce the ideal amount of thik/runny for the pankackes you're going for.

## Stuffing
> I like to stuff the pancakes with fruit and bits of dark chocolate. If the pancakes are not stuffed they're a little dry & bland... perfect if they're going to be used as a maple syrup vehicle! But I don't feel good about eating *that* much mayple syrup, so I stuff them. 

> I like to use a Dark chocolate slab from a craft chocolateer that's bewteen 75% and 90% cocoa -- it's sweet, but not too sweet

- Banana/ blueberries/ durian | 1/2 to 1 cup | chopped into bits about the size of a thumbnail if neccesary
- Dark chocolate slab | 1/2 slab | chopped into bits about the size of a thumbnail

Chop up the stuffing & set aside

## Frying
> Turn the oven on to warm (to no more than 90*C) \
> You can also put the plates into the oven to warm

- grapeseed oil | as needed |

> the kind of oil used needs to have a neutral flavour and a high smoke point, anthing with these properties will do. It's just to fry the pancakes in!

Put oil in the pan and bring the pan up to a medium hot heat.

Pour about 1/2 cup of batter into the hot pan, letting it spread out into about the right size for the final pancake. \
Set two pacakes going this way, & quickly drop in the stuffing ingredients. \
Pour a small anount of batter over the stuffing to just covered \
Leave the pancakes to cook until the edges are dry & bubbles form \
Flip the pancakes over to cook on the other side

Put cooked pancakes into a warm oven (~ 90*C) to keep them warm while you cook the rest of the batch. 


## Topping
> Even stuffed, the pancakes will want some more moisture to be perfectly delicious -- chopped fruit and maple syrup are just the thing!

- kiwifruit/ oranges / apples | to taste | thinly sliced

Spread fruit that has been halved/quatered and then thinly sliced over the tops of the pancakes & drizzle the lot with mayple syrup.
