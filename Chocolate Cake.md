Quantity | 1 cake
Time to make | 2 hours

> preheat the oven to 140*C
> grease the cake tin with coconut oil

## Wet ingredients #1
- Water | 1 Cup | hot (boiling/ just off boiling)
- Pitted Dates | 1/2 Cup |
- Vanilla | 1/2 tsp |
- Instant coffee | 2 tsp |
- sugar | 4 Tbsp |

Put the ingredients together & leave to soke for ~10 mins. \
Blend together once soked. 

## Wet ingredients #2
- Soy milk | 1 cup|
- Vinegar | 1 Tbsp |
- Oil | 2 Tbsp |

Stir together into a thick liquid. The vinegar should curdle the milk slightly. 

> I use hemp seed oil and apple cidar vinegar, but I don't think the kind makes a difference. 

## Dry ingredients
- Buckwheat flour | 1 1/2 cups |
- Cornflour | 1/4 cup |
- Almond meal | 1/4 cup |
- Salt | 1/8 tsp |
- Dutch cocoa | 2/3 cup|
- Baking soda | 2 tsp |
- Baking powder | 2 tsp |
- Guar gum | 2 tsp |

Sift ingredients to remove lumps & mix everything together.

## Bake

Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet. \
Mix it all together to form a sticky batter. 

Scoop the batter into a greased cake tin. \
*Bake at 140\*C for 60 mins*

>Last time I baked this at 180*C for 30mins. The cake cracked and was not cooked in the middle. This suggests that the temperature needs to be lower and the cook time longer. 

## Ice & Decorate

- Hazelnuts/Walnuts | 1/2 cup | chopped

Ice with [Avaocado Ganache](https://github.com/Bessie/recipes/blob/main/Avacado%20Ganache.md) and top with chopped nuts
